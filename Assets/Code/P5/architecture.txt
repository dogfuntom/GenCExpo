We don't want to couple a slot (where a work can be shown) and a work (the work itself) together.
Because it wastes time when editing the scene (e.g. moving exhibits).
And it makes ponentially interesting logic hard to implement, like distributing works randomly.
While it's not clear if randomization itself is a good idea, it's still a clear sign of smelly maintainability.

At the very least, there must be 3 things:
* Slot (directly a part of scene).
* Work (generative 2d image shown by/in the slot).
* Manager (limits the combined LOD of all slots/works).

Slot should be a component because it's a direct part of the scene.
Manager should be a component because it's hard to implement it otherwise (not worth it at current stage of the project).
Work should be a plain object to reduce the number of components (and because it has no business knowing the dirty implementation details).
